    <h2>We start small with one mission in mind, that mission to get get people health and happy.
        Here at Elite, we focus on health thru diet and many forms of excerise.
        Our center also focus on recovery and we have a MMA gym as well. The founder of the center 
        grew up over weight and struggled with diets and workout programs. Over the years Scott Jacobs,
        studied and went down rabbit hole after rabbit hole of infomation. He tried diet after diet, researched
        all about how foods affected the body and hormones, also he looked in to different techniques 
        of recovery and also what it does to the body on a cellular level. Scott's dream was the center and
        helping people.
